dextrocardia,A bronchial disease that is a chronic inflammatory condition of one or more bronchi or bronchioles marked by dilatation and loss of elasticity of the walls resulting from damage to the airway wall leading to the formation of small sacs on the bronchial wall and impairment of cilia mobility in the lung. Inflammation of the bronchial wall increases mucus secretion which serves as a breeding ground for bacteria.
