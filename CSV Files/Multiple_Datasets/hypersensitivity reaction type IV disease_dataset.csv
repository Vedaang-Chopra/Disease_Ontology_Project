autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome,A hypersensitivity reaction type IV disease that is an inherited disorder in which the body cannot properly regulate the number of immune system cells (lymphocytes). It is characterized by the production of an abnormally large number of lymphocytes. Accumulation of excess lymphocytes results in enlargement of the lymph nodes,Canale-Smith syndrome,hypersensitivity reaction type IV disease
obsolete adherence syndrome,A hypersensitivity reaction type IV disease that is an inherited disorder in which the body cannot properly regulate the number of immune system cells (lymphocytes). It is characterized by the production of an abnormally large number of lymphocytes. Accumulation of excess lymphocytes results in enlargement of the lymph nodes,Fat adherence syndrome of extraocular muscle (disorder),hypersensitivity reaction type IV disease
obsolete acroparesthesia syndrome,A hypersensitivity reaction type IV disease that is an inherited disorder in which the body cannot properly regulate the number of immune system cells (lymphocytes). It is characterized by the production of an abnormally large number of lymphocytes.
