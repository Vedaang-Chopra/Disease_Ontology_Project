Name,Definition,Synonym,Output
suppurative thyroiditis,A Pseudomonas infectious disease that is caused by a Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa resulting in pulmonary edema. This bacterium releases immunogenic bacterial components that can gain access to airway epithelium and immune cells in the lung thus causing airway inflammation. P. aeruginosa is the common cause of hospital acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonias.,Suppurative thyroiditis,thyroiditis
Riedel's fibrosing thyroiditis,A Pseudomonas infectious disease that is caused by a Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa resulting in pulmonary edema. This bacterium releases immunogenic bacterial components that can gain access to airway epithelium and immune cells in the lung thus causing airway inflammation. P. aeruginosa is the common cause of hospital acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonias.,Riedel fibrosing thyroiditis,thyroiditis
acute thyroiditis,A Pseudomonas infectious disease that is caused by a Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa resulting in pulmonary edema. This bacterium releases immunogenic bacterial components that can gain access to airway epithelium and immune cells in the lung thus causing airway inflammation. P. aeruginosa is the common cause of hospital acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonias.,Riedel fibrosing thyroiditis,thyroiditis
subacute thyroiditis,A viral infectious disease that affects CD8 lymphocytes,Subacute thyroiditis,thyroiditis
subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis,An autoimmune disease of blood that is characterized by deficient red blood cells caused by auto-antibodies.,Subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis,thyroiditis
