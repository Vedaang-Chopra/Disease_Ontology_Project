CD40 ligand deficiency,A combined T cell and B cell immunodeficiency that is a X-linked immunodeficiency with hyperimmunoglobulin M (XHIM) affecting isotype switching and is caused by the absence of CD40 ligand which is normally expressed on activated CD4+ T cells.

severe combined immunodeficiency,A combined T cell and B cell immunodeficiency that is caused by a defect in several genes encoding for B and T lymphocytes resulting in individuals with non-functional immune systems.,SCID,combined T cell and B cell immunodeficiency
